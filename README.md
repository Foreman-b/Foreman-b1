## How I Work
- I build by **iterating quickly** — prototype → test → automate  
- I document everything (README, runbook, deployment notes) so others can reproduce my work  
- I value feedback and share progress publicly to help others learn

## Contributions & Community
- Open to mentorship and collaboration on back-end & cloud projects  
- I contribute to workshops and help peers with technical troubleshooting and interview prep  
- I welcome contributions to my repos — open issues or PRs are appreciated
